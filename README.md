# readYodaFiles

compares different YODA files and produces 2 files, one with the plots containing all the smallest points and the other one with the biggest. 

The new files are stored in a new directory called newFiles (this directory is created during the run) 

Observe we do the example for only 2 files here, for visual simplicity.  But it's easy to generalize it to more than 2, only adding them in the main file, following the same sintax as for p1, p2.
